    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Our goal at Wild Current Adventures is to connect people with the beauty and excitement of the river in order to create outdoor experiences that they will never forget.  
        Adventure should be more than just an adrenaline rush, in our opinion; it should be an opportunity to connect, laugh, challenge boundaries, and discover peace in nature. 
         In addition to providing excitement, our guided rafting adventures teach about conservation, water safety, and the environment. 
         With us, every paddle stroke is a step toward building a sense of community, self-assurance, and respect for the rivers that impact our planet.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Families seeking excitement, college students, business groups, and nature lovers seeking to get away from it all will love our rafting company. 
         We customize every trip to fit your comfort and excitement level, regardless of your degree of experience. 
         Anyone ready to disconnect, immerse themselves in nature, and create some seriously splashy memories is welcome to Wild Current Adventures, which offers anything from mild scenic floats to adventurous whitewater adventures.</p>
