        <h3>My nickname is Ayo</h3>
        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Kikelomo Ayooluwa Okuribido, but you can call me Ayo.Im Nigerian and i live in Baltimore, MD. I am currently home now, but in the fall i will be back on campus.

Im a Computer Science major with a minor in Photography, and Im working toward a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree. My goal is to build a career in tech—possibly software development or something creative like web or UX design—while keeping photography as a passion on the side.

Some of my favorite hobbies include going on adventures, especially walking in the woods and spending time by streams, lakes, and rivers—basically, if theres water, Im there! I also love cooking and trying new recipes. I also love taking pictures especially sunsets, abstract, vintage, cinimatic i can keep on going but you get my point.

Im not married and dont have children yet. Im currently focused on my education to prepare for my future career.

What I love most about BYU-Idaho is the uplifting spiritual environment and the opportunity to grow both academically and personally. Im taking this Web Design and Development course to build valuable, practical skills. I see web design as a powerful tool in todays world, whether for building my own portfolio, starting a project, or helping others with their websites.

Ive been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for a while, and one of my favorite scriptures is 2 Nephi 2:25: “Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.” Its a beautiful reminder to live with purpose and seek joy in all that we do.

Im excited to learn with all of you this semester and see how we grow together!</p>
